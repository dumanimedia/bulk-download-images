# Image Downloader for Projects

This Python script is designed to download images for different projects from predefined URLs. It automatically organizes the images into folders for each project, making it easy to store, share, or use the images in your project directories.

## Features

- **Project organization**: Automatically creates a folder for each project based on the slug and downloads banner, thumbnail, and gallery images.
- **Easy to use**: Just update the project list and run the script to download all associated images.
- **Image types**: Downloads images in `.svg` format (adjustable as per project needs).
- **Customizable**: You can easily modify or add more projects by updating the `projects` list.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dumanimedia/bulk-download-images.git
   cd bulk-download-images
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:

   The script uses the `requests` library to download the images. You can install it using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   Once you have the script and dependencies set up, simply run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python download_images.py
   ```

   This will download the images into folders named after the project slugs.

## Configuration

You can customize the projects by editing the `projects` list in the `download_images.py` file. Each project is defined by a dictionary with the following keys:

- **slug**: A unique identifier for the project (used for folder names).
- **banner**: URL to the banner image.
- **thumbnail**: URL to the thumbnail image.
- **gallery**: A list of URLs to gallery images.

### Example project configuration:

```python
{
    "slug": "project-name",
    "banner": "https://example.com/banner.svg",
    "thumbnail": "https://example.com/thumbnail.svg",
    "gallery": [
        "https://example.com/gallery1.svg",
        "https://example.com/gallery2.svg"
    ]
}
```

## Example Output

After running the script, you will see project folders like:

```
/bright-future-non-profit/
    - banner.svg
    - thumbnail.svg
    - gallery-1.svg
    - gallery-2.svg
    - gallery-3.svg

/green-retail-co/
    - banner.svg
    - thumbnail.svg
    - gallery-1.svg
    - gallery-2.svg
    ...
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing dependencies**: If you get errors related to missing modules, ensure that you've run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.
- **Permission issues**: Make sure you have write permissions in the directory where you're running the script.
